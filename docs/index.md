**Strange** is a mod for Minecraft 1.14 that adds **exploration**, **adventure** and **treasure** to the game without dramatically altering the vanilla playstyle.
Each feature is configurable and can be disabled, allowing you to customize your experience.

## Main features
* [Underground Ruins](features/underground_ruins) - found scattered below the surface
* [Runestones](features/runestones) - standing stone circles that can take you to points of interest
* [Scrolls](features/scrolls) - a scrollkeeper villager sells quest scrolls for you to complete
* [Spells](features/spells) - magical artifacts and special enchantment books
* [Totems](features/totems) - lost treasure that provides powerful actions
* [Travel Journal](features/travel_journal) - a craftable journal to keep track of your findings
* [The Outerlands](features/outerlands) - a distant area far from the safety of spawn

## Installation
This mod requires **Forge** (at least version 28.1.118) and **Charm** (version 1.5) as dependencies.
*Charm* makes some small changes to the vanilla gameplay and is easy to configure.

**PROBABLY IMPORTANT!** *Strange* is currently in alpha and will likely be for a while. It may break your world,
your game, your cats, it might not play well with other mods etc. Please get in touch via the Github issue tracker if it's something
really serious. 

*Strange* is designed to play nicely with [Quark](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark). If Quark is present then extra Quark-specific quests,
decoration and integration will be available.

Thank you to everyone who contributed ideas and to all playtesters.  Also thanks to [mcvinnyq](https://www.curseforge.com/members/mcvinnyq/followers) for the writing desk texture.

After playing various modpacks with the following great mods, I acknowledge how much influence they have had on *Strange*. I recommend taking a look at what they offer, even for older versions of Minecraft.

## Warning!
While there has been a careful effort to balance the risk vs. reward, you may find some of the rarest loot to be too OP.
