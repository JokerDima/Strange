# Totem of Flying

This white totem allows creative-style flight as long as you are holding it.  It can only be obtained from treasure chests within the [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults) underground structure.

## Using the totem

Jump while holding the totem **in any hand** to activate it. The totem takes 1 point of durability damage every time flight is initiated. While you are airborne your experience points will begin to decrease every second.

Use left-shift to descend. Once you touch the earth the flying effect will end and your experience points will stop draining.

If you run out of experience or the totem is no longer in your hand, the flying effect will end and the player will fall to earth.
