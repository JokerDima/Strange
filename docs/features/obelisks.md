# Obelisks

Obelisks are vertical stacks of [Runestones]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/runestones) constructed by a player.  The order of the glyphs in the obelisk matches that of a location anywhere in the Overworld.  A player can throw an *ender pearl* at the obelisk to immediately travel to the location it describes.

## Getting co-ordinates

Every location entry created in a [Travel Journal]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/travel_journal) comes with a unique set of glyphs that describe the entry's exact position in the Overworld.  At first, these glpyhs will be unknown and will appear as question marks.  By travelling through [Runestones]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/runestones), you "learn" glyphs.  Learned glyphs then appear as part of the set of glyphs for the location in the journal.

When you have discovered all the required runestone glyphs (there are no more question marks) you may build an obelisk that exactly matches the order of glyphs in the journal.

## Getting obelisk blocks

As you travel across the Overworld you will find [Stone Circles]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circles).  These structures may have [Runestones]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/runestones) on top of stone pillars that let you travel to particular points of interest around your world.  Using a *Silk Touch* enchanted pickaxe, you can mine and collect the runestones from the top of the stone pillars.  Once mined, a runestone block becomes an "obelisk" block and is ready to start constructing obelisks.

If you don't use a Silk Touch pickaxe the runestones will drop nothing.

## Building and using obelisks

Once you have a complete set of glyphs for a location entry in your travel journal, build a vertical obelisk from stones with glyphs that **precisely match** the order in the journal.  When finished, throw an ender pearl at the completed obelisk to travel immediately to the location descibed in your journal.  There is no limit to the number of times you may travel, but an ender pearl is required for each journey.

If you want, you can take apart your obelisk using a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe.

## Warning!

You must match the glyphs on the stones in exactly the same order as the glyphs in the journal.  Getting even one glyph wrong could have very bad consequences!  At best, you may be transported to a completely random, unintended location.  At worst, you may find yourself embedded in a mountain - or hundreds of blocks into the sky - or perhaps even in the void beneath the world.

If you feel the need to be one of the pioneers of obelisk travel and roll your own glyphs, it is highly recommended to take a bound [Totem of Returning]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_returning) with you on your adventure to quickly get yourself out of a sticky situation.
