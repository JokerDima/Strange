# Totems

![All the available totems](https://i.postimg.cc/MZPqxpTb/Totems.jpg)

Expanding on the vanilla "Totem of Undying", *Strange* offers a number of new totems that grant the player protection and special powers:

* [Totem of Shielding]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_shielding) - hold in your **shield inventory slot** to redirect **all** your incoming damage to the totem instead (expires after too much damage).
* [Totem of Returning]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_returning) - single-use instant teleport designed to be bound to a location and then activated to take you back there.
* [Totem of Transferring]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_transferring) - sneak-click while holding to store any block in the totem.  Click again to place the block down.
* [Totem of Preserving]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_preserving) - sneak-click while holding to transfer and store all your items in the totem.  Click again to break the totem and restore them.
* [Totem of Enchanting]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_enchanting) - sneak-click while holding to transfer and store all your experience points in the totem.  Click again to break the totem and restore them.
* [Totem of Flying]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_flying) - allows flight (jump to activate) while the totem is held. Flying consumes experience points.

## Finding totems

Some totems such as the *Totem of Returning* and *Totem of Shielding* are more common than the others. Click on the links above to find out how to obtain them. Other totems are incredibly rare and can only be found in [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults) which are large underground structures [far from the spawn point]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands).
