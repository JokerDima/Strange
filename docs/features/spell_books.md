# Spell Books

Spell Books contain instructions for how to perform [Spells]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/spells). They are rare items that can only be found in **Stronghold library rooms** or bookshelves in the [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults)

## Lecterns and Enchantment

Once you have found a spell book you can place it on a *[Lectern](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lectern)*. At this point, the spell book is ready to charge a [Moonstone]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/moonstones) with a spell. This is done by moving close to the lectern while holding a moonstone and letting the enchantment take place. The stone will change color and name to match the spell with which it is enchanted.

## Using a staff

Instead of enchanting a moonstone you can craft a [Staff]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/staff).  The combination of a staff in your main-hand and a spell book in your off-hand lets you cast spells quickly while on the move, instead of being restricted to charging from a lectern.  However, spell books **take damage** when used this way.

You may repair spell books on an anvil with paper or combine them with another spell book of the same type.  Check your books often to make sure they are in good condition.
