# Spell Books

Spell Books contain instructions for how to perform [Spells]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/spells). They are elusive and rare; a small set of books are "common" and are available in dungeon loot and villager quest rewards. The entire range of spell books can often only be found within [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults) - typically **Library Rooms**.

## Lecterns and Enchantment

Once you have found a spell book you can place it on a *[Lectern](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lectern)*. At this point, the spell book is ready to charge a [Moonstone]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/moonstones) with a spell. This is done by moving close to the lectern while holding a moonstone and letting the enchantment take place. The stone will change color and name to match the spell with which it is enchanted.

After enchanting a moonstone, the spell book may take a point of durability damage. Books are weak and may be repaired on an anvil with paper, or combined with another spell book of the same type. Check your books often to make sure they are in good condition.
