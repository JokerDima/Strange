# Illusioners

Illusioners are vanilla Minecraft illagers but are not enabled in the game by default.
*Strange* enables Illusioners to spawn in certain conditions:
* within Dark Forests of [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands)
* inside [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults)
* inside some [Underground Ruins]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/underground_ruins) (rare)

If an Illusioner is killed within [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) then they drop either a [Totem of Returning]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_returning) or a [Totem of Shielding]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_shielding).  Otherwise, they only drop experience points.  This is also the case if another mod enables Illusioners.
