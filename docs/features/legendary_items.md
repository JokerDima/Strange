# Legendary Items

Inside the [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults) found in the [Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) you may find tools and weapons that contain enchantments above their normal enchantment maximum, up to level 10.  These items can be found in chests with names such as "Legendary Diamond Axe", and if Quark is present, a randomly colored enchantment glint.

Each Legendary Item's enchantments, as well as the overall amount that all enchantments can potentially be increased, are customizable in the mod's config file.
