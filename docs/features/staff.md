# Staff

The staff is a craftable item made from sticks and [Moonstone]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/moonstones).  Its purpose is to allow the user to perform [Spells]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/spells) while on the move.

## Casting spells

Holding a staff in your main-hand and a [Spell Book]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/spell_books) in your off-hand lets you cast the spell from the book.  This is achieved by holding down the right-click like you would charge a bow.  After a short time, the spell will be cast and the following occurs:

* the [spell]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/spells) is cast on its **target** 
* you will lose XP according to the **spell cost**
* the spell book in your off-hand takes a point of durability damage
* the staff in your main-hand takes a point of durability damage

You may quickly change to another spell book by selecting it in your inventory, pressing the "switch to off-hand" key (by default F), and then selecting the staff again.

## Unbreaking

Enchanting a staff with the vanilla *Unbreaking* enchantment reduces its chance of taking durability damage every time it is used in the same mechanic as other vanilla tools or weapons.

## Efficiency

The staff benefits from the vanilla *Efficiency* enchantment.  For every level of efficiency:
* casting time is reduced (by 5 ticks per level)
* the chance of the spell book taking damage is reduced (by 12% per level)

## Fortune

The staff benefits from the vanilla *Fortune* enchantment.  For every level of fortune:
* the **spell cost** (amount of XP lost when casting) is reduced by one level per level of fortune
* the chance of the **spell cost** occuring is reduced (by 18% per level)
