# Vaults

The **Vaults** are sprawling underground structures found exclusively in the distant parts of the overworld - [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands).  Within vault chests you can find some of the rarest and most powerful loot that *Strange* has to offer.

## Finding vaults

The location of vaults are a secret guarded by Illagers.  Pillager outposts in [the Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) are very likely to contain a map to a vault in the chest at the top of the outpost structure.  You can find your way to the Outerlands by getting a totem from a high-tier [Scrollkeeper]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrollkeepers).

Once you have a *Vaults map*, find the X and start digging.  By default, Vaults will spawn in Mountain biomes.

## What to expect

The structure contains a number of Illagers determined to protect it.  These Illagers do not despawn once triggered.  [Illusioners]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/illusioners) and **Evokers** are present, supported by Pillagers and Vindicators.

A number of other monster spawners can be found in rooms and corridors. Remember, monsters in [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) have health/strength/speed buffs, so monster spawners present a greater threat than normal.

Each vault structure is unique and may have many levels all the way down to bedrock.  Some rooms connect to lower or higher levels via staircases or drops.

Treasure chests often contain a [Totem]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totems).  These chests are **the only place** to find the rarest totems.  Barrels and Crates should also be checked as there is a slight chance they will also contain totems.  Don't pass by the bookshelves!  Any of the vault bookshelves might be a "bookshelf chest" and contain rare books and items too.

**NOTE**: A single vault structure is not guaranteed to contain **all** the rarest loot available.  Find another distant Pillager Outpost to search for more vaults underground.

## Ruined Vaults

Sometimes you might come across a "ruined vault" in Mountain biomes closer to spawn point than the Outerlands.  These consist of a single large room with a [Stone Circle]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circles), some treasure and possibly some Pillagers guarding it.  While you may find rare dungeon items, these ruined vaults do not contain any special totems or treasure.
