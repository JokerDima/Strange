# Vaults

The **Vaults** are sprawling underground structures found exclusively in the distant parts of the overworld - [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands).  Within vault chests you can find some of the rarest and most powerful loot that *Strange* has to offer.

## Finding vaults

The location of vaults are a secret guarded by Illagers.  There are two ways to get a *Vaults Map*:

* Pillager outposts in [the Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) are very likely to contain a map to a vault in the chest at the top of the outpost structure.  You can find your way to the Outerlands by getting a totem from a high-tier [Scrollkeeper]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrollkeepers).
* [Stone Circles]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circles) in the Outerlands spawn treasure chests at the centre of the circle. This chest contains Pillager outpost loot, so there is a chance that it will contain a map.

Once you have a *Vaults map*, find the X and start digging to reach the "starting" room.  By default, Vaults will spawn only in Mountain biomes.

## What to expect

The structure contains a number of Illagers determined to protect it.  These Illagers do not despawn once triggered.  [Illusioners]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/illusioners) and **Evokers** are present, supported by Pillagers and Vindicators.

A number of other monster spawners can be found in rooms and corridors. Remember, monsters in [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) have health/strength/speed buffs, so monster spawners present a greater threat than normal.

Each vault structure is unique and may have many levels all the way down to bedrock.  Some rooms connect to lower or higher levels via staircases or drops.

Treasure chests often contain a [Totem]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totems), a special [Enchanted]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/enchantments) or a [Legendary Item]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/legendary_items).  These chests are **the only place** to find these treasures<sup>1</sup>.  Barrels and Crates should also be checked as there is a slight chance they will also contain totems.  Don't pass by the bookshelves!  Any of the vault bookshelves might be a "bookshelf chest" and contain rare books and items too.

**NOTE**: A single vault structure is not guaranteed to contain **all** the rarest loot available.  Find another distant Pillager Outpost chest or distant Stone Circle (they spawn with chests in the outerlands) to search for more vaults underground.

## Ruined Vaults

Sometimes you might come across a "ruined vault" in Mountain biomes closer to spawn point than the Outerlands.  These consist of a single large room with a [Stone Circle]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circles), some treasure and possibly some Pillagers guarding it.  While you may find rare dungeon items, these ruined vaults do not contain any special totems or treasure.

## Notes

With permissions enabled, you may search for the closest vault by using the command `/locate strange:vaults`.  In the "inner lands" this will lead you to a ruined vault; in the outer lands you will find the full-sized underground structure.

<small>1. The default configuration only allows these treasure items to spawn in vault chests, but you can change this in the mod's config if you would like treasure items to appear in normal dungeon loot.</small>
