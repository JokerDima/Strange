# Vaults

The **Vaults** are sprawling underground structures found exclusively in the distant parts of the overworld - [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands). To find the Vaults, first locate a distant [Stone Circle]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/runestones) and then dig down.  Chances are you'll find your way into the welcome room of the vaults and begin your quest for the rarest treasures that *Strange* has to offer.

**NOTE**: not all distant Stone Circles have vaults.  There is a 2 in 3 chance of the structure being buried beneath the circle.

## What to expect

The structure contains a number of Illagers determined to protect it.  These Illagers do not despawn once triggered.  [Illusioners]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/illusioners) and **Evokers** are present, supported by Pillagers and Vindicators.

A number of other monster spawners can be found in rooms and corridors. Remember, monsters in [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) have health/strength/speed buffs, so monster spawners present a continuous threat.

Each vault structure is unique and may have many levels all the way down to bedrock.  Some rooms connect to lower or higher levels via staircases or drops.

Treasure chests often contain a [Totem]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totems).  These chests are **the only place** to find the rarest totems.  Barrels and Crates should also be checked as there is a slight chance they will also contain totems.  Don't pass by the bookshelves!  Any of the vault bookshelves might be a "bookshelf chest" and contain rare books and items too.

**NOTE**: A single vault structure is not guaranteed to contain **all** the rarest loot available.  Find another distant Stone Circle to search for more vaults underground.
