# Totem of Transferring

This blue totem lets you move any<sup>1</sup> block, including tile entities<sup>2</sup>, from one location to another.  It can only be obtained from treasure chests within the [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults) underground structure.

## Using the totem

While holding the totem in any hand, right-click while sneaking to remove the block from the world and store it in the totem.  The totem will then have the enchantment glint effect.  Right click with the totem to place the stored block at the location you are looking at.  The totem will be destroyed in the process.
