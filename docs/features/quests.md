# Quests

Quests require you to take some kind of actions in return for a reward.  Quests are written on [Scrolls]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrolls) which are typically sold by [Scrollkeeper]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrollkeepers) villagers. You must **Accept** a quest from a scroll before it begins. Once the quest criteria has been fulfilled, you can complete the quest and gain its reward by returning to the scrollkeeper ("Handing in the quest").

By default you may undertake 2 quests simultaneously.

## Keeping track of quests

Quests that are in progress are viewable at the top of your inventory screen.  Each box represents a single quest and shows its name and progress (as a bar).  Click on the box to show a more detailed view including the necessary actions you need to complete the quest criteria. 

From this screen you may also **Quit** a quest.  You do not get any reward for any progress you have made.

## Provided items

Some quests provide you with one or more items as soon as you accept them.  These items are often relevant to the quest, for example a fishing rod for a "gather fish" quest or a compass/map to help locate a chest or mob.

## Quest actions

Each quest is unique and might require you to undertake more than one action to complete the quest.  Here are the actions that you might be asked to perform:

* **Craft items** - build the items on a crafting table.
* **Gather items** - pickup (or otherwise have in your inventory) the required items.
* **Hunt creatures** - kill the specified mobs.
* **Mine blocks** - break the required blocks.
* **Fetch creatures** - lure or drag mobs back to the scrollkeeper.
* **Locate items** - use the provided compass/map to fetch items from a lost chest.
* **Encounter** - use the provided compass/map to locate and destroy powerful mob(s).

### Time limits

Some quests may also ask you to complete their actions **within a time limit**.  If you do not "hand in" the completed quest to the scrollkeeper within the time limit, the quest is failed and removed from your inventory.

## Rewards

Once a completed quest is returned to a scrollkeeper for hand in, you will receive the rewards listed on the quest scroll.  Rewards are either:
* one or more items delivered to your inventory
* experience points applied immediately

As well as an item reward, quest completion also causes [Scrollkeepers]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrollkeepers) to "level up". This is useful for obtaining more lucrative scrolls and therefore quest rewards.

Quests with a higher **value** will increase the villager's experience more than a lower value quest.  Higher value quests also give a higher chance to provide rare items as a reward for completion.
