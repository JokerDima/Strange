# Underground Ruins

Forgotten ruins may be found scattered throughout the underground to add some danger and interest to mining and extra exploration opportunities. These ruins may be complex structures that contain monsters and common/dungeon loot. Some ruins repeat throughout all biomes but there are also biome-specific ruins.

## Finding ruins

Underground ruin maps can sometimes be found in dungeon loot (for Overworld ruins) and Nether Fortress chests (for Nether ruins).

Ruins often have monster spawners so may be located by listening out for many similar monster sounds while exploring underground. Additionally, ruin complexes may be quite large and intersect a cave or gorge. Look out for stone bricks!

## Notes

With permissions enabled, you may search for the closest underground ruin by using the command `/locate strange:underground_ruin`.
