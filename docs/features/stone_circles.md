# Stone Circles

In *flat biomes* (such as plains and desert) you may find a stone circle constructed from cobblestone and stone.  Some of the stone pillars may have a [Runestone]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/runestones) on the top.  With the proper tools and some study, these runestones can help you reach distant locations.

Stone Circles are usually found quite close to each other but if you are in a forest or mountainous area you may have to travel quite far to find one.

## In the Outerlands

If you find a stone circle in [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) there is chance that you fill find a map to nearby [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults) in a chest at the centre of the circle.  Vaults contain some of the greatest treasure and artifacts that *Strange* has to offer, hidden inside a large labyrinth of corridors and rooms, patrolled with illagers and challenging mobs.  Read more about the Vaults [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults).

## Finding Stone Circles

It is possible to obtain a special compass to the closest stone circle by holding a normal compass and an iron ingot under a full moon.  This compass can be turned back into a normal compass on a crafting table.  This feature only works if Charm's "Bound Compasses" feature is enabled. 

## Notes

With permissions enabled, you may search for the closest stone circle by using the command `/locate strange:stone_circle`.
