# Stone Circles

In *flat biomes* (such as plains and desert) you may find a stone circle.  In the overworld they are constructed from stone and cobblestone.  Some of the stone pillars may have a [Runestone]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/runestones) on the top.  With the proper tools and some study, these runestones can help you reach distant locations.  Stone Circles can sometimes be found quite close to each other but if you are in a forest or mountainous area you may have to travel quite far to find one.

## In other dimensions

Stone circles can also be found in the *Nether* or the *End*.  In the Nether, stone circle pillars are made from nether brick and form at any vertical position - this makes them a challenge to find.  In the End, stone circles appear on the floating islands.  In both dimensions you may find a loot chest in the centre of the circle.  Runestones in these dimensions will always transport you to the Overworld.

## In the Outerlands

If you find a stone circle in [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) there is a high probability that you will find [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults) buried beneath them. Vaults  contain some of the greatest treasure and artifacts that *Strange* has to offer, hidden inside a large labyrinth of corridors and rooms, patrolled with illagers and challenging mobs.  Read more about the Vaults [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults).

## Notes

With permissions enabled, you may search for the closest stone circle by using the command `/locate strange:stone_circle`.
