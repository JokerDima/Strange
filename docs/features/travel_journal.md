# Travel Journal

The **Travel Journal** is a craftable item designed to help you catalogue places of interest around your world.

Make a location entry in the journal at any time; give the location a name, a color and take a photo of the area to help you remember what you found!

Once a location is recorded in the journal, you can craft a compass or map to help you find your way back to it.

## Crafting

Create a travel journal by combining a *[Book and Quill](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Book_and_Quill)* with a *[Compass](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Compass)*.
By default a travel journal lets you record 30 location entries.

## Recording a location

When you find a location you want to store in the journal, open the travel journal by right-clicking it, then click "New Location".  The screen changes to show information about the location entry that will be added.

From this screen, type a name for the entry at the top.  By default it uses the name of the biome you are in.

Click one of the color dyes to change the color of the entry if you want to categorise it.

Click the "Take photo" button if you want to record a picture of this location.

Once you are happy with the information, click "Save" to return back to the main journal.  Your new entry will appear in the list, colored accordingly.

## Finding your way back

With lots of location entries in your journal it can be difficult to remember where they are.

### By compass

With a compass in your inventory, open the journal and click the compass icon next to the location you want to return to.  The compass will take the name and color of the journal entry.  Simply follow this compass to find your location.  (Requires Charm's "Compass Binding" module!)

### By map

With an empty map in your inventory, open the journal and click the map icon next to the location you want to return to.  The map will take the name and color of the journal entry.  Open the map and make your way to the colored banner on the map to find your location.

### By totem

If you are lucky enough to have a [Totem of Returning]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_returning) in your inventory, open the journal and click the totem icon next to the location you want to return to.  You will be immediately teleported and the totem will be destroyed.

## Notes

Travel journals are not specific to the player who created them or created entries in them.  You may freely give your travel journal to others to allow them to find locations you recorded and make use of any entries they create.

Photos you take against for each location entry are **client-side only** and will not be available to other players - unless you give them a copy of all files from your `screenshots` folder that begin with `strange_`. 

Take care of your journal.  Travel journals are fragile items and susceptible to explosions, lava, despawning...
