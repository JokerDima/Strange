# Ambience

Biome-specific environment sounds for both day and night to add extra depth to the otherwise uncomfortably silent world.

Cave sounds increase in intensity as you mine deeper, but fade as you light up the surrounding area.

Mineshafts have specific wooden creaking sounds, Quark's *Crystal Caves* (if enabled) have reverberating glass sounds, and villages have some general activity sounds during the day.

Ambient sound volume can be controlled using the "Ambient Sounds" slider in Minecraft's options.  You can also disable ambience completely from the mod's config file, and at some point there will be an "ambience-free" download option for *Strange* to keep the file size down if you don't need this feature.

## Music

Four additional background tracks have been added to the game:

* "There" (þarna) - random Overworld track
* "Beneath" (Undir) - random Nether track (when under lava ocean)
* "Mouse" (Mús) - random Icy Biome track
* "Stone" (Steinn) - random Overworld track (when underground)

Music can be disabled via the config file.  There will also be download links to these music files and their original format (Renoise) at some point when I get the time to do anything.
