# Scrolls

**Scrolls** contain quest instructions. Clicking on a scroll shows you the details about the quest. You may then make a decision about whether you want to **Accept**, **Decline** or **Close** the quest scroll.  Clicking **Accept** begins the quest and removes the scroll from your inventory. You can then see your quest progress at the top of your inventory screen. [Follow this link]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/quests) to read more about quests.

Scrolls are typically sold by the [Scrollkeeper]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrollkeepers) villager but may also be found in dungeon loot.

## Tiers

Scrolls can be one of five tiers, represented by the color of their seal.  They correspond to the villager tier levels.  A new "novice" scrollkeeper sells only "novice" (tier 1) scrolls represented with a dark gray seal. When the villager levels up to "apprentice", they will trade "apprentice" (tier 2) scrolls represented with a brown seal. The seal color matches the villager level badge.

Each scroll tier increases the difficulty and reward of the offered quest. "Diamond" (tier 5) quest scrolls have the chance to reward [Totems of Returning]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_returning) that take you to a distant [Stone Circle]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circle) - this helps you begin your search for underground [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults).
