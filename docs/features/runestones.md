# Runestones

Runestones allow you to travel vast distances across your world.  They are found on top of [Stone Circles]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circles) in any of the three vanilla dimensions.

## Runestone travel

Once you have found a runestone, throw an *ender pearl* at it.  After a moment, you will be transported to a new location corresponding to the runestone's destination.  There are 12 runestones that lead to the following destination types:

* your spawn point (the most common stone)
* another stone circle
* a village
* a desert pyramid
* a jungle temple
* an ocean ruin

When you travel through a runestone, you will "learn" its destination.  Looking at any runestone of this type in future will tell you the type of destination that the stone will transport you to.  Travelling through the same runestone again will always transport you to the same place in the world.

## Hints

It is worth carrying extra ender pearls with you when you travel through a runestone.  If you get lost, you might be able to find another stone circle with a "spawn point" runestone.

Runestone blocks cannot be harvested even with a silk touch pickaxe. However, there *may* be a legitimate way to move them to a new location.<sup>1</sup>

Runestones will be shuffled according to the world seed - you must rediscover a runestone's destination type when you start a new world!

<small>1. Runestone blocks derive their destination co-ordinates from their own position in the world.  If one is moved to a new location it will transport you to a completely different place in the world that still respects the destination type.</small>
