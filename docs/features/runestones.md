# Runestones

Runestones allow you to travel vast distances across your world.  They are found on top of [Stone Circles]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circles) in the overworld, with 16 possible rune glyphs to discover.

## Runestone travel

Once you have found a runestone, throw an *ender pearl* at it.  After a moment, you will be transported to a new location corresponding to the runestone's destination.  12 runestones lead to the following destination types:

* your spawn point (the most common stone)
* another stone circle
* a village
* a desert pyramid
* a pillager outpost
* a jungle temple
* a mineshaft
* a swamp hut
* an igloo
* an ocean ruin
* an underground ruin
* a big dungeon (if Quark is enabled and configured)

If you reach the [Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) there are 4 additional runestones to discover that lead to the following:

* another stone circle in the outerlands
* a pillager outpost in the outerlands
* a village in the outerlands
* a big dungeon (if Quark is enabled and configured)

When you travel through a runestone, you will "learn" the glyph and its destination<sup>1</sup>.  Focusing the player's view on any runestone with this glyph in future will tell you the type of destination that the stone will transport you to.  Travelling through the same runestone again will always transport you to the same location it previously sent you to.

## Hints

It is worth carrying extra ender pearls with you when you travel through a runestone.  If you get lost, you might be able to find another stone circle with a "spawn point" runestone.

Runestone blocks can be harvested with a silk touch pickaxe.  The block becomes an [Obelisk]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/obelisks) that can be placed vertically with other stones.

Runestones will be shuffled according to the world seed - you must rediscover a runestone's destination type when you start a new world!

<small>1. Runestone blocks derive their destination co-ordinates from their own position in the world.  If one is moved to a new location (e.g. in creative mode) it will transport you to a completely different place in the world that still respects the destination type.</small>
