# Runestones

In *flat biomes* (such as plains and desert) you may find a stone circle.  In the overworld they are constructed from stone and cobblestone.  Some of the stone pillars may have a **runestone** on the top.  With the proper tools and some study, these runestones can help you travel vast distances around the world.

## Runestone travel

Once you have found a runestone on top of a pillar, throw an *ender pearl* at it.  After a moment, you will be transported to a new location corresponding to the runestone's destination.  There are 12 runestones that lead to the following destination types:

* your spawn point (the most common stone)
* another stone circle
* a village
* a desert pyramid
* a jungle temple
* an ocean ruin

When you travel through a runestone, you will "learn" its destination.  Looking at any runestone of this type in future will tell you the type of destination that the stone will transport you to.  Travelling through the same runestone again will always transport you to the same place in the world.

## In other dimensions

Stone circles can also be found in the *Nether* or the *End*.  In the Nether, stone circle pillars are made from nether brick and form at any vertical position - this makes them a challenge to find.  In the End, stone circles appear on the floating islands.  In both dimensions you may find a loot chest in the centre of the circle.  Runestones will always transport you to the Overworld from these dimensions.

## In the Outerlands

The rarest runestones transport you to destinations in [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands).  If you find a stone circle in the Outerlands there is a high probability that you will find **Vaults** buried beneath them. This structure contains some of the greatest treasure and artifacts that the mod has to offer, hidden inside a large labyrinth of corridors and rooms, patrolled with illagers and challenging mobs.  [Read more about the Vaults here]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults).

## Helpful hints

It is worth carrying extra ender pearls with you when you travel through a runestone.  If you get lost, you might be able to find another stone circle with a "spawn point" runestone.

Runestone blocks cannot be harvested even with a silk touch pickaxe. However, there *may* be a legitimate way to move them to a new location.<sup>1</sup>

Runestones will be shuffled according to the world seed - you must rediscover where a runestone will take you when you start a new world!


<small>1. Runestone blocks derive their destination co-ordinates from their own position in the world.  If one is moved to a new location it will transport you to a completely different place in the world that still respects the destination type.</small>
