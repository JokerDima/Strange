# Moonstones

Moonstones are craftable items made from quartz and glowstone. 

## Enchanted moonstone

Moonstones can be enchanted to hold [Spells]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/spells) and then activated to perform the held spell's effect.  To enchant a moonstone, hold it in your hand and approch a *[Lectern](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lectern)* that holds a [Spell Book]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/spell_book).  You must have enough experience levels to enchant the moonstone (hover over the spell book to see the required levels).

Once the moonstone is enchanted it will change color and name to match that of the spell it contains. The moonstone is now enchanted. You can hover over the moonstone to see some information about what the spell will do and **how many uses** the spell has.

## Activating

Right-click an enchanted moonstone to activate the spell it contains.  Normally the stone is destroyed after the spell is performed.  If the spell allows **multiple uses** then the number of uses will be decreased each time the moonstone is activated. When there are no more uses, the moonstone will be destroyed.

## Finding enchanted moonstones

Occasionally you may discover **enchanted moonstone** in dungeon loot, nether fortress and buried treasure chests. Since these moonstones are already enchanted, they do not need a spell book and may be used immediately.

## As part of a staff

A moonstone is used in the crafting recipe for a [Staff]{{ site.baseurl }}/features/staff).
