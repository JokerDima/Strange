# Spells

This branch of *Strange* adds some lightweight magical effects into the game in the form of **Spells**. The source of spells are [Spell Books]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/spell_books) which may be found in **Stronghold library rooms** and on bookshelves in [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults).

There are two ways to use spell books to cast a spell:

1. Place the spell book on a lectern and stand close to the lectern while holding a [Moonstone]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/moonstones).  The moonstone will become enchanted with the spell.
2. Build a [Staff]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/staff) (from sticks and [moonstone]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/moonstones)), place the spell book in your off-hand, and hold right-click to cast the spell from your staff.

## Spell information

Each spell has a color that helps distinguish it. The trim of the spell book and the color of the enchanted moonstone match the spell that they contain. **Note**: some spells share a color.

You can find out more about the spell that will be activated by hovering over the spell book that transferred it, or the moonstone that was enchanted by the book.

## Spell target

Right-click an enchanted moonstone, or hold right-click to charge and cast a spell from your staff. The resulting spell may target one of the following:

* **area of effect** - all blocks/creatures in range are affected by the spell
* **targetted** - the spell is cast in the direction the player is facing with a physical transfer of energy to the target location
* **focus** - the spell is cast immediately and precisely at the block or creature the player is looking at
* **self** - the spell applies only to the caster

You can find out what a spell targets by hovering over the spell book or enchanted moonstone.

## Common spells

The entire library of spells is left to the player's discovery<sup>1</sup>, but here are some examples of common spells:
* **Aura** - heal all creatures in range (area of effect)
* **Growth** - quickly grow all crops, grass and trees (area of effect)
* **Knockback** - repel target creature away from you (targetted)
* **Levitate** - causes target creature to rise into the air (targetted)
