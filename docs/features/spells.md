# Spells

This branch of *Strange* adds some lightweight magical effects into the game in the form of **Spells**. The source of spells are [Spell Books]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/spell_books) and the physical containers of power are [Moonstones]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/moonstones).

You can enchant moonstones by standing close to a spell book on a lectern. The spell will be copied to the held stone and made ready for activation.

## Spell information

Each spell has a color that helps distinguish it. The trim of the spell book and the color of the enchanted moonstone match the spell that they contain. However, some spells may share a color.

You can find out more about the spell that will be activated by hovering over the spell book that transferred it, or the moonstone that was enchanted by the book.

## Activation

Right-click an enchanted moonstone to activate the spell. This may be one of the following:
* **area of effect** - all blocks/creatures in range are affected by the spell
* **targetted** - the spell is cast in the direction the player is facing with a physical transfer of energy to the target location
* **focus** - the spell is cast immediately and precisely at the block or creature the player is looking at
* **self** - the spell applies only to the caster

## Common spells

The entire library of spells is left to the player's discovery<sup>1</sup>, but here are some examples of common spells:
* **Aura** - heal all creatures in range (area of effect)
* **Growth** - quickly grow all crops, grass and trees (area of effect)
* **Knockback** - repel target creature away from you (targetted)
* **Levitate** - causes target creature to rise into the air (targetted)
