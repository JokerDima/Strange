# The Outerlands

**The Outerlands** consists of the part of the overworld beyond 12,000,000 blocks and up to the world border (by default 30,000,000 blocks).  This mod changes some of the aspects of this part of the world:

* You can find underground [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults) below [Stone Circles]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/runestones) in the outerlands.  The Vaults contain some very rare [Totems]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totems) and [Spellbooks]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/spells).
* Monsters become more difficult as you travel further into the outerlands; they have greater health, strength and speed.  They also drop greater amounts of experience.
* [Quests]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrolls) are tougher but give greater reward.
* [Illusioners]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/illusioners), powerful magic illagers, spawn naturally in Dark Forests of the outerlands.

## Notes

The outerlands features can be configured via the `strange-common.toml` file.  This lets you specify the threshold that the outerlands begins, the monster difficulty, and other options.

This mod also provides some additional ambient music triggered in various places within the outerlands.
