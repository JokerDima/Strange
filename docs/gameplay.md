# Gameplay

The loot available in *Strange* is more exotic than you would find in a "vanilla+" modpack, but is considerably less powerful than that offered by other magic and industry mods.

Consideration has been given to gating very powerful items in locations that are very difficult to reach and require progression through the mod.
Additionally, the power available to the player using these items is limited in terms of XP and item fragility.
If you are looking for more of a vanilla experience then it is recommended to disable or nerf the following features:

* [Totem of Flying]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_flying) - non-creative limited flight
* [Totem of Enchanting]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_enchanting) - storage for player XP
* [Totem of Preserving]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_preserving) - grave marker for when a player is killed
* [Totem of Shielding]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_shielding) - invulnerability while totem is in shield slot
* The following [Spells]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/all_spells):
    * **Drain** - takes health from surrounding mobs
    * **Explosion** - explosion at target
    * **Portal** - easy transfer between dimensions
    * **Summon** - spawn Iron Golem at target
    * **Transfer** - move blocks (including some normally non-movable blocks)

## Why

I like exploring in open-world settings.  I like discovering interesting landscapes, cataloguing locations and getting some reward for pursuing the horizon further and further.  It's also nice to have RPG elements but not in a hand-holding or restrictive way.

I don't feel that Minecraft offers enough of this without mods - however, most mods take something away from the immersion of the base game.

So, after lots of mountain hikes and long journeys, there's *Strange*.  I hope you enjoy.
