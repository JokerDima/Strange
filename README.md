# Strange

A Vanilla+++ Minecraft mod based on [Charm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/charm).  For Minecraft **1.14.4**, recommended Forge version **28.0.45**, 
and depends on **Charm 1.3.2**.

"Strange" contains things that enhance vanilla Minecraft but are too exotic to be considered Vanilla+.
The main focus is exploration and discovery with maybe some OP tools and treasure thrown in for good measure.

This mod is incomplete and needs your help to playtest it!
Please report any bugs in the [Github issues tracker](https://github.com/svenhjol/Strange/issues).  With your issue, include:
1. Steps to reproduce the problem
2. A stacktrace / crash report
3. (Optional) screenshots

New feature requests will not be accepted on the issue tracker.  We are currently working on porting as many 
"Strange" features from Charm 1.12 before starting a highly secret roadmap of new features and functionality.
